The update from Asterisk 1.4 to Asterisk 20 implements over 15 years of Asterisk bug fixes, security improvements and enhancements.  It brings with it the latest Asterisk applications, channel drivers and additional functionality.</p> <p></p> <p>This update required app_rpt (the Asterisk application that is AllStar) and it's various modules to be heavily modified. Many memory leaks have been addressed, modules load or refresh more reliably and many bugs have been squashed.
